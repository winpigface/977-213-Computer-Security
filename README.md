This is my answer code from computer security lab.

You have to use [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) to see the questions.
- **Linux/Mac** : type `nc` on terminal.
- **Window** : You have to install [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html) first, then type `ncat` on terminal.

I didn't done all questions. Some question is too hard for me 🥲🥲.
